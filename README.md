# Flame Application Internship
 This is a small 2D-web-game for a coding test for a possible amazing internship at the Dutch Game Studio!
 
 I can only work a maximum of 8 hours on this, so the scope will be pretty small. And I just arrived on Erasmus, but I tried to make time free for this!

 That's why I chose a piece of the game Cuphead!
 
 If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!
