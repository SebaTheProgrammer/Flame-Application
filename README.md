# Flame Application Test for Internship
 This is a small 2D-web-game for a coding test for a possible amazing internship at The Dutch Game Studio!
 
 I can only work a maximum of 8 hours on this, so the scope will be pretty small. (I also just arrived on Erasmus, but I tried to make time for this!)

 That's why I chose a piece of the game Cuphead! I've made a previous C++ version of it, so why not now showing that I can remake a little part in Flame?
 
 If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!

 The game: -> https://sebatheprogrammer.github.io/

 # Instructions:
 WASD- to move, SPACE to jump. (If you are on the top of the walking area and walk up, you automaticly jump. This is just to make it a little bit harder.)
 
 Press 'E' to shoot. 

 The balloons have 5 hp, but if you can kill one you get +100 score.

 Reach 5000 points to win! Or get 0 HP to lose...

 Have fun! :)
