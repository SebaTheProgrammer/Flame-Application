# Flame Application Internship
 This is a small 2D-web-game for a coding test for a possible amazing internship at the Dutch Game Studio!
 
 I can only work a maximum of 8 hours on this, so the scope will be pretty small.

 That's why I chose a piece of the game Cuphead!
 
 If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!

 # Planning:
 - Setting up Flame: 30m
(I've never worked with it before. It was nice to learn a new engine.)
 
 - Designing/planning scope: 5m
 
 - Making base character: 1h
